# Planner

## Description 


This project was created as a planner that allows a user to input events into the planner at specific times during a typical work day with current, past, and present hours shown at different colors.
The events that are saved into the planner are placed into local storage so that it will also be available at a later date as needed. 
Planners are important to keep track of important events and appointments that one may have.

The biggest difficulty I have faced so far is being able to coordinate between the save button pushed and the corresponding input being saved.
Another difficulty faced is that I forgot to use Moment.js in the original code and have been backtracking to replace code using the Date() function with moment().

## Installation

To utilize the project, open in your internet browser.


## Usage 

The project provides a planner for a user during hours of a typical workday. The user can input an event into the schedule and save it to local storage to be displayed.
